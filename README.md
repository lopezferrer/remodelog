# RemodeLog
An app to keep track of all the things that happen during house renovation: people involved, inventory of resources and materiales required and used, money spent, etc.

At its current state, RemodeLog is a basic CRUD app, with a cloud-based database and hosted in Heroku, so it can be accessed from anywhere.

With Remodelog, I can:</br> 
- Keep a log of all the works carried out in my appartment's renovations.</br>
- Add a new work including all the relevant information about each work.</br>
- Edit the work's Remodelog entry as it progresses or in case there are new ideas.</br>
- Erase a work in case there is a mistake.</br>
- List the information about each work and contact info of the person responsible.</br>
